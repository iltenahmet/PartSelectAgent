PartSelect Number **PS10065979**
Manufacturer Part Number **W10712395**
This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Installation Instructions
Richard from OAKLAND, CA
Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error. The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow. The written instructions were good. But "a picture is worth a thousand words." Eventually it worked. The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original. Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

[ Dishwasher Rack Track Stop ](https://www.partselect.com/</PS11746591-Whirlpool-WP8565925-Rack-Track-Stop.htm?SourceCode=18>) [ ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 120 Reviews ](https://www.partselect.com/</PS11746591-Whirlpool-WP8565925-Rack-Track-Stop.htm?SourceCode=18#CustomerReview>)
PartSelect Number **PS11746591**
Manufacturer Part Number **WP8565925**
The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC
Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step. They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - ("Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?"). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

PartSelect Number **PS11756150**
Manufacturer Part Number **WPW10546503**
This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install. It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. The installation has been rated as "easy" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you! Your dishwasher should have a left and right upper rack adjuster, and both are the same part. These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

Kathie from Breda, IA
Broken parts on rack
Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem. We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack. The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!! I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!! Will use this sight again if repairs are needed. [Read more...](https://www.partselect.com/</PS11756150-Whirlpool-WPW10546503-Dishwasher-Upper-Rack-Adjuster.htm?SourceCode=18#Instructions>)

Manufacturer Part Number **W10712394**
This rack adjuster kit (Dishrack Adjuster Kit, Adjuster Kit, Dishwasher Rack Adjuster) will adjust the height of the upper rack of your dishwasher. It connects to the dishrack. The kit is constructed of grey plastic and metal, and measures approximately 12 inches wide and 6.5 inches tall. The rack adjuster can break from material fatigue or prolonged high temperature exposure. High temperature exposure can compromise the integrity of the materials. If the rack adjuster breaks, your upper rack may fall down, may be unlevel, or the door may not close. This kit includes the parts to replace the left and right-side rack adjusters and has been upgraded to a more durable metal design (2 adjuster assemblies, 1 left hand and 1 right hand actuator cover, 2 gray adjuster covers, and 2 gray adjuster housings)

Installation Instructions
Paul from Encinitas, CA
Replace rack adjusters - wheel were broken
Replacement was pretty easy after figuring out how to unsnap/unlock the old pieces. Tools only used to do a little prying and poking, but really aren't needed. Everything either snaps or slides together. Piece of cake [Read more...](https://www.partselect.com/</PS10064063-Whirlpool-W10712394-Dishwasher-Dish-Rack-Adjuster-Kit-Left-and-Right-Side.htm?SourceCode=18#Instructions>)

Manufacturer Part Number **WPW10195622**
This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.

The tine pivot clip, also known as the tine row pivot, is used in dishwashers and is located in the upper dishrack. At around 3 inches in length, the clip is used to keep the tine row in place in the dishrack. If your clip is cracked or damaged, it is best to replace this part. To repair, first lift the release tab and hold the other side to prevent it from falling off. After lifting it off, you can set the new clip on the tine row and lock it up. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer for further installation instructions and guidance. Remember to wear work gloves as a safety precaution. This repair was rated as very easy by our customers and should be done in 15 minutes or less.

Broken parts on rack
Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem. We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack. The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!! I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!! Will use this sight again if repairs are needed. [Read more...](https://www.partselect.com/</PS11748190-Whirlpool-WPW10082853-Tine-Pivot.htm?SourceCode=18#Instructions>)

This dish rack slide rail is a genuine OEM replacement part that is compatible with various models of dishwasher. It is designed to fit on the right side of the dishwasher. The slide rail or track supports the upper dish rack and allows it to slide in and out of the dishwasher smoothly so that you can easily load and unload your dishes. It is made of stainless steel and can be found mounted to the side of the interior cavity of the dishwasher. If your dish rack is unstable and difficult to pull in and out, you will likely need to replace the slide rail. Mounting hardware is sold separately.

Installation Instructions
Kenneth from YACOLT, WA
Dish rack tracks failed over time
The repair was easy. You will need to make sure any screws securing the dishwasher are removed at the top front of the dishwasher under the counter and above the top of the dishwasher. Then pull the dishwasher out exposing roughly 18" of each side of the dishwasher then use a socket to remove the screws holding the tracks in place, 4 in total on each side. Then install new tracks and slide dishwasher back into place and secure.
